# JIFFY

## Currently Under Rewrite

I am currently rewriting this project. At the moment, I am focusing on developing the Login Page and Signup Page. 

Feel free to check out the older version of the project at [jiffyview.netlify.app](https://jiffyview.netlify.app/).

## Project Overview

**JIFFY** is a social media app inspired by Facebook and Instagram, featuring a layout style similar to YouTube. 

- **Frontend**: Developed using Tailwind CSS and React.js to create a user-friendly experience.
- **Backend**: Utilizes Firebase for secure data storage and user authentication.

### Key Features

- **User-Friendly Web Apps**: Developed with React JSX for a seamless user experience.
- **Deferred Data Handling**: Implemented deferred data in the React Router DOM package with React Suspense to set a fallback loading component while retrieving data.
- **Performance Optimization**: Used the window-react library to render only part of the data set, improving app performance and smoothness.
- **Authentication and Data Sync**: Integrated Firebase for user authentication and data synchronization, ensuring secure data storage.
- **Debugging and Troubleshooting**: Utilized React Developer Tools and browser console for effective debugging.
- **Deployment**: Deployed the production-ready application using Netlify.
